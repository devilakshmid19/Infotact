# ðŸ›’ðŸ“¢ Customer Segmentation & ðŸŽ¤ Speech Emotion Recognition Projects  

This repository contains two data science projects:  
1. **Customer Segmentation** - Categorizing customers into meaningful groups for better marketing strategies.  
2. **Speech Emotion Recognition** - Analyzing speech to detect emotions, transcribe text, and improve voice recognition.  

Both projects utilize **machine learning, clustering techniques, and data analysis** for business and AI-driven applications.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Speech Emotion Recognition  
- **Description:** This project processes speech data to detect emotions, transcribe speech, and improve voice recognition. It can be used for **virtual assistants, sentiment analysis, and voice-controlled systems**.  
- **Dataset Used:**  
  - **RAVDESS** (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)  
  - **CREMA-D** (Crowd-Sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset)  
- **Notebook:** [`speech-emotion-recognition.ipynb`](speech-emotion-recognition.ipynb)  

#### ðŸ“Œ Features:  
âœ… **Acoustic Analysis** â€“ Extracts pitch, tone, and volume from speech.  
âœ… **Emotional Detection** â€“ Classifies emotions (happiness, anger, neutral).  
âœ… **Speech Recognition** â€“ Converts speech into text in real-time.  
âœ… **Real-Time Processing** â€“ Detects speech with minimal delay.  
âœ… **Noise Filtering** â€“ Removes background noise for better accuracy.  
âœ… **Dataset Diversity** â€“ Works with multilingual and varied environmental datasets.
